  Chapter 3 n Web Application Technologies
  
  Same-Origin Policy
  
  The same-origin policy is a key mechanism implemented within browsers that 
  is designed to keep content that came from different origins from interfering 
  with each other. Basically, content received from one website is allowed to read 
  and modify other content received from the same site but is not allowed to 
  access content received from other sites.
  
  If the same-origin policy did not exist, and an unwitting user browsed to a 
  malicious website, script code running on that site could access the data and 
  functionality of any other website also visited by the user. This may enable the 
  malicious site to perform funds transfers from the user’s online bank, read his 
  or her web mail, or capture credit card details when the user shops online. For 
  this reason, browsers implement restrictions to allow this type of interaction 
  only with content that has been received from the same origin.
  
  In practice, applying this concept to the details of different web features and 
  technologies leads to various complications and compromises. Here are some 
  key features of the same-origin policy that you need to be aware of:
  
   n A page residing on one domain can cause an arbitrary request to be made 
  to another domain (for example, by submitting a form or loading an 
  image). But it cannot itself process the data returned from that request.
  
   n A page residing on one domain can load a script from another domain and 
  execute this within its own context. This is because scripts are assumed 
  to contain code, rather than data, so cross-domain access should not lead 
  to disclosure of any sensitive information.
  
   n A page residing on one domain cannot read or modify the cookies or 
  
  other DOM data belonging to another domain.
  
  These features can lead to various cross-domain attacks, such as inducing 
  user actions and capturing data. Further complications arise with browser 
  extension technologies, which implement same-origin restrictions in different 
  ways. These issues are discussed in detail in Chapter 13.
  
  HTML5
  
  ing reasons:
  
  HTML5 is a major update to the HTML standard. HTML5 currently is still under 
  development and is only partially implemented within browsers.
  
  From a security perspective, HTML5 is primarily of interest for the follow-
  
   n It introduces various new tags, attributes, and APIs that can be lever-
  aged to deliver cross-site scripting and other attacks, as described in 
  Chapter 12.

   n It modiﬁ es the core Ajax technology, XMLHttpRequest, to enable two-way 
  cross-domain interaction in certain situations. This can lead to new cross-
  domain attacks, as described in Chapter 13.
  
   n It introduces new mechanisms for client-side data storage, which can lead 
  to user privacy issues, and new categories of attack such as client-side SQL 
  injection, as described in Chapter 13.
  
  “Web 2.0”
  
  This buzzword has become fashionable in recent years as a rather loose and 
  nebulous name for a range of related trends in web applications, including the 
  following:
  
   n Heavy use of Ajax for performing asynchronous, behind-the-scenes requests
  
   n Increased cross-domain integration using various techniques
  
   n Use of new technologies on the client side, including XML, JSON, and Flex
  
   n More prominent functionality supporting user-generated content, infor-
  
  mation sharing, and interaction
  
  As with all changes in technology, these trends present new opportunities 
  for security vulnerabilities to arise. However, they do not deﬁ ne a clear subset 
  of web application security issues in general. The vulnerabilities that occur in 
  these contexts are largely the same as, or closely derived from, types of vulner-
  abilities that preceded these trends. In general, talking about “Web 2.0 Security” 
  usually represents a category mistake that does not facilitate clear thinking 
  about the issues that matter.
  
  Browser Extension Technologies
  
  Going beyond the capabilities of JavaScript, some web applications employ 
  browser extension technologies that use custom code to extend the browser’s 
  built-in capabilities in arbitrary ways. These components may be deployed as 
  bytecode that is executed by a suitable browser plug-in or may involve installing 
  native executables onto the client computer itself. The thick-client technologies 
  you are likely to encounter when attacking web applications are
  
   n Java applets
  
   n ActiveX controls
  
   n Flash objects
  
   n Silverlight objects
  
  These technologies are described in detail in Chapter 5.

  Chapter 3 n Web Application Technologies
  
  State and Sessions
  
  The technologies described so far enable the server and client components of 
  a web application to exchange and process data in numerous ways. To imple-
  ment most kinds of useful functionality, however, applications need to track the 
  state of each user’s interaction with the application across multiple requests. For 
  example, a shopping application may allow users to browse a product catalog, 
  add items to a cart, view and update the cart contents, proceed to checkout, and 
  provide personal and payment details.
  
  To make this kind of functionality possible, the application must maintain a 
  set of stateful data generated by the user’s actions across several requests. This 
  data normally is held within a server-side structure called a session. When a 
  user performs an action, such as adding an item to her shopping cart, the server-
  side application updates the relevant details within the user’s session. When the 
  user later views the contents of her cart, data from the session is used to return 
  the correct information to the user.
  
  In some applications, state information is stored on the client component 
  rather than the server. The current set of data is passed to the client in each 
  server response and is sent back to the server in each client request. Of course, 
  because the user may modify any data transmitted via the client component, 
  applications need to protect themselves from attackers who may change this 
  state information in an attempt to interfere with the application’s logic. The 
  ASP.NET platform makes use of a hidden form ﬁ eld called ViewState to store 
  state information about the user’s web interface and thereby reduce overhead 
  on the server. By default, the contents of the ViewState include a keyed hash 
  to prevent tampering.
  
  Because the HTTP protocol is itself stateless, most applications need a way to 
  reidentify individual users across multiple requests for the correct set of state 
  data to be used to process each request. Normally this is achieved by issuing 
  each user a token that uniquely identiﬁ es that user’s session. These tokens may 
  be transmitted using any type of request parameter, but most applications use 
  HTTP cookies. Several kinds of vulnerabilities arise in relation to session han-
  dling, as described in detail in Chapter 7.
  
  Encoding Schemes
  
  Web applications employ several different encoding schemes for their data. Both 
  the HTTP protocol and the HTML language are historically text-based, and dif-
  ferent encoding schemes have been devised to ensure that these mechanisms 
  can safely handle unusual characters and binary data. When you are attacking 
  a web application, you will frequently need to encode data using a relevant

  scheme to ensure that it is handled in the way you intend. Furthermore, in many 
  cases you may be able to manipulate the encoding schemes an application uses 
  to cause behavior that its designers did not intend.
  
  URL Encoding
  
  URLs are permitted to contain only the printable characters in the US-ASCII 
  character set — that is, those whose ASCII code is in the range 0x20 to 0x7e, 
  inclusive. Furthermore, several characters within this range are restricted because 
  they have special meaning within the URL scheme itself or within the HTTP 
  protocol.
  
  The URL-encoding scheme is used to encode any problematic characters 
  within the extended ASCII character set so that they can be safely transported 
  over HTTP. The URL-encoded form of any character is the % preﬁ x followed by 
  the character’s two-digit ASCII code expressed in hexadecimal. Here are some 
  characters that are commonly URL-encoded:
  
   n %3d — =
  
   n %25 — %
  
   n %20 — Space
  
   n %0a — New line
  
   n %00 — Null byte
  
  A further encoding to be aware of is the + character, which represents a 
  
   URL-encoded space (in addition to the %20 representation of a space).
  
  NO TE For the purpose of attacking web applications, you should URL-
  encode any of the following characters when you insert them as data into an 
  HTTP request:
  
  space % ? & = ; + #
  
  (Of course, you will often need to use these characters with their special 
  meaning when modifying a request — for example, to add a request parameter 
  to the query string. In this case, they should be used in their literal form.)
  
  Unicode Encoding
  
  Unicode is a character encoding standard that is designed to support all of the 
  world’s writing systems. It employs various encoding schemes, some of which 
  can be used to represent unusual characters in web applications.
  
  16-bit Unicode encoding works in a similar way to URL encoding. For 
  transmission over HTTP, the 16-bit Unicode-encoded form of a character is

  Chapter 3 n Web Application Technologies
  
  the %u preﬁ x followed by the character’s Unicode code point expressed in 
  hexadecimal:
  
   n %u2215 — /
  
   n %u00e9 — é
  
   n %c2%a9 — ©
  
   n %e2%89%a0 — (cid:122)
  
  UTF-8 is a variable-length encoding standard that employs one or more bytes 
  to express each character. For transmission over HTTP, the UTF-8-encoded form 
  of a multibyte character simply uses each byte expressed in hexadecimal and 
  preceded by the % preﬁ x:
  
  For the purpose of attacking web applications, Unicode encoding is primarily 
  of interest because it can sometimes be used to defeat input validation mecha-
  nisms. If an input ﬁ lter blocks certain malicious expressions, but the component 
  that subsequently processes the input understands Unicode encoding, it may 
  be possible to bypass the ﬁ lter using various standard and malformed Unicode 
  encodings.
  
  HTML Encoding
  
  HTML encoding is used to represent problematic characters so that they can be 
  safely incorporated into an HTML document. Various characters have special 
  meaning as metacharacters within HTML and are used to deﬁ ne a document’s 
  structure rather than its content. To use these characters safely as part of the 
  document’s content, it is necessary to HTML-encode them.
  
  HTML encoding deﬁ nes numerous HTML entities to represent speciﬁ c literal 
  
  characters:
  
   n &quot; — "
  
   n &apos; — '
  
   n &amp; — &
  
   n &lt; — <
  
   n &gt; — >
  
   n &#34; — "
  
   n &#39; — '
  
  In addition, any character can be HTML-encoded using its ASCII code in deci-
  mal form:
  
  or by using its ASCII code in hexadecimal form (preﬁ xed by an x):

   n &#x22; — "
  
   n &#x27; — '
  
  When you are attacking a web application, your main interest in HTML 
  encoding is likely to be when probing for cross-site scripting vulnerabilities. If 
  an application returns user input unmodiﬁ ed within its responses, it is prob-
  ably vulnerable, whereas if dangerous characters are HTML-encoded, it may 
  be safe. See Chapter 12 for more details on these vulnerabilities.
  
  Base64 Encoding
  
  Base64 encoding allows any binary data to be safely represented using only 
  printable ASCII characters. It is commonly used to encode e-mail attachments 
  for safe transmission over SMTP. It is also used to encode user credentials in 
  basic HTTP authentication.
  
  Base64 encoding processes input data in blocks of three bytes. Each of these 
  blocks is divided into four chunks of six bits each. Six bits of data allows for 64 
  different possible permutations, so each chunk can be represented using a set 
  of 64 characters. Base64 encoding employs the following character set, which 
  contains only printable ASCII characters:
  
  ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz0123456789+/
  
  If the ﬁ nal block of input data results in fewer than three chunks of output 
  
  data, the output is padded with one or two = characters.
  
  For example, here is the Base64-encoded form of The Web Application Hacker’s
  
  Handbook:
  
  VGhlIFdlYiBBcHBsaWNhdGlvbiBIYWNrZXIncyBIYW5kYm9vaw==
  
  Many web applications use Base64 encoding to transmit binary data within 
  cookies and other parameters, and even to obfuscate (that is, to hide) sensitive 
  data to prevent trivial modiﬁ cation. You should always look out for, and decode, 
  any Base64 data that is issued to the client. Base64-encoded strings can often 
  be easily recognized by their speciﬁ c character set and the presence of padding 
  characters at the end of the string.
  
  Hex Encoding
  
  Many applications use straightforward hexadecimal encoding when transmit-
  ting binary data, using ASCII characters to represent the hexadecimal block. 
  For example, hex-encoding the username “daf” within a cookie would result 
  in this:

  Chapter 3 n Web Application Technologies
  
  As with Base64, hex-encoded data is usually easy to spot. You should always 
  attempt to decode any such data that the server sends to the client to understand 
  its function.
  
  Remoting and Serialization Frameworks
  
  In recent years, various frameworks have evolved for creating user interfaces in 
  which client-side code can remotely access various programmatic APIs imple-
  mented on the server side. This allows developers to partly abstract away from 
  the distributed nature of web applications and write code in a manner that is 
  closer to the paradigm of a conventional desktop application. These frameworks 
  typically provide stub APIs for use on the client side. They also automatically 
  handle both the remoting of these API calls to the relevant server-side functions 
  and the serialization of any data that is passed to those functions.
  
  Examples of these kinds of remoting and serialization frameworks include 
  
  the following:
  
   n Flex and AMF
  
   n Silverlight and WCF
  
   n Java serialized objects
  
  Next Steps
  
  We will discuss techniques for working with these frameworks, and the kinds 
  
  of security issues that can arise, in Chapters 4 and 5.
  
  So far, we have described the current state of web application (in)security, exam-
  ined the core mechanisms by which web applications can defend themselves, 
  and taken a brief look at the key technologies employed in today’s applications. 
  With this groundwork in place, we are now in a position to start looking at the 
  actual practicalities of attacking web applications.
  
  In any attack, your ﬁ rst task is to map the target application’s content and 
  functionality to establish how it functions, how it attempts to defend itself, and 
  what technologies it uses. The next chapter examines this mapping process 
  in detail and shows how you can use it to obtain a deep understanding of an 
  application’s attack surface. This knowledge will prove vital when it comes to 
  ﬁ nding and exploiting security ﬂ aws within your target.
